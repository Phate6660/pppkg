Running:
- `cargo run` (it will print a quick help, but it also ensures certain dirs are created)
- `cp -r packages/* ~/.pppkg/packages/`
- Then do whatever with it (e.g. `cargo run -- install firefox`)

If you'd like to see debug output, set the env variable RUST_LOG to info.

Operations:
- i | install
- l | list
  + -a | --available
- m | meta (view info about a package)

How it works:
- Parses package config at $HOME/.pppkg/packages/PACKAGE_NAME.toml
- Save tarball to $HOME/.pppkg/downloads/
- Extract tarball to $HOME/.pppkg/opt/PACKAGE_NAME/
- TODO: Think of a way to dynamically find and symlink binaries to $HOME/.pppkg/bin/
